# LSTM-based-Stacked-Autoencoder
This is the implementation of LSTM-based Staked Autoencoder (LSTM-SAE) model

This model is mentioned in paper by the title:

### Unsupervised Pre-training of a Deep LSTM-based Stacked Autoencoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Problems

*There are six python files and one csv file:*

1. **pollution.csv** --> Multivariate data set
2. **1layer_selection.py**---> this code for hyperparameter selction of the model and **1** referes to one hidden layer 
3. **1layer_evaluate.py** ---> this code for evaluating the model and also **1** means one hidden layer
